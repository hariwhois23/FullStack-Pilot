            <strong>"Ipsum"</strong> is a placeholder text,
             often used in design and publishing,
              that stands in for actual content.
               It's a scrambled Latin text that, while appearing similar to Latin, has no real meaning. The purpose of using "ipsum" is to allow designers to focus on the visual layout and structure of a document without being distracted by actual text.
